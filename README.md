========

The package provides Go bindings for for libpd â€” Pure Data embeddable audio synthesis library.<br />
All the binding code has automatically been generated with rules defined in [core.yml](/core.yml).

Before using you must install [libpd](https://github.com/libpd/libpd) library. Don't worry, it installs fine and
that's the fastest way to start unsing PD as an embedded DSP.

### Usage

```
$ go get github.com/xlab/libpd-go
```

### Demo

There is a simple Pure Data player implemented in Go that can read patches, including extras, and play them via [portaudio-go](https://github.com/xlab/portaudio-go). So you will need to get portaudio installed first.

```bash
$ brew install portaudio
$ go get github.com/xlab/libpd-go/cmd/pdplay

$ pdplay -h

Usage: pdplay [OPTIONS] PATCHDIR

A minimal PureData player implemented in Go.

Try this patch for example too: [PerotinusRandom on pdpatchrepo.info](http://pdpatchrepo.info/patches/patch/6) (also a precompiled version with **freeverb~** extra for OS X 64-bit located here: [PerotinusRandom.zip](http://dl.xlab.is/music/pd/PerotinusRandom.zip)). Awesome chorus!
